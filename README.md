Some visuals from Hydra, which I will use to practice my Javascript skills.

My first encounter with code was Hydra. For those who don't know, Hydra is a platform for generating live visuals through browser-based coding, it was created by Olivia Jack and I think it's a good way to start coding because of the feedback loop environment of the web. I'm not just talking about most of Hydra's cool feedback loop-based effects, but also how it makes coding more beginner-friendly by allowing you to see the output of your coding in (almost) real time, whether you understand it or not. 

So I'm going to try to go through some of these humble examples of using Hydra and add comments to the code and what it does in a way to understand it better. 

Of course you can see some tutorials or ressources that are out there by de Hydra and github community, but I'll try to work on it in a really sintezised way trough my own code so that every body can understand what I've done.

Or watch this nice demostration that Olivia itself did in 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw7tPDrFIQg&t=507s
